Here are documents containing all code and theory for the entire course:

### First day morning

* [Introduction!](slides/00_Introduction)

0_intro
1_Data
2_Bayesian -- (mcmc)
3_Stan (Andrew)

lunch activity: COUNT BIRDS!

### First day afternoon
* data simulation and parameter recovery -- poisson birds
* model diagnostics 
* intro to plotting
Stan2
* discrete predictors

## DAY 2
* 4 linear 
* some matrix algebra

* return to the group intercept model -- abundance across plots
* secret weapon -- model for parameters
* multilevel intercepts
* multilevel slopes

## Day 3

* modelling multiple intercepts -- e.g. intercepts for site and species
* modelling different slopes for each species
* modelling multiple slopes and intercepts at the same time
* random intercepts with a fixed predictor

## Day 4

* modelling slopes and intercepts as correlated
* NC vs centered param
* intro to GPs

## Day 5
* Everything everywhere all at once (60 to 90 minutes on the Full Models)





* lme4 paper (bates)
* 

## Day 4 

*gaussian process regression

* Slides to introduce Stan

* linear models
  * bidonia regression simulation
  * simulation -- to measure uncertainty
  * using var-covar and simulating confidence intervals
* simple l
  
notes: could we rephrase the model to have the central tendency and the sigma
cf to baye methods


TODOS:
* need to edit the title slide for the
