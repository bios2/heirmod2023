Mathematically, the probability that it rains is written as\n\n$$P(r)$$\n\nand the probability that it does not rain would be written as\n\n$$1 - P(r)$$\n\n:::\n\n## Probabilities and events\n\nUsually, these basic notions of probabilities are presented using coin flipping. When a coin is flip, it is usually assumed that \n\n$$P(r)=0.5$$\n\n. . .\n\nHowever, in probability theory, P(r) can have any value ranging between 0 and 1.\n\n. . .\n\n*Example*\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://em-content.zobj.net/source/telegram/386/cloud-with-rain_1f327-fe0f.webp){fig-align='center' width=15%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat do you think is the probability that it will rain at the end of the lecture?\n\n## Probabilities and events\n\nAt this point we can note that when we add the probabilites of all possible events, the sum will always be 1\n\n. . .\n\n*Example*\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://em-content.zobj.net/source/telegram/386/cloud-with-rain_1f327-fe0f.webp){fig-align='center' width=15%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n$$P(r) + (1-P(r)) = 1$$\n\n. . . \n\nThis is true only if the events are independent from each other\n\n## Independent !?\n\n:::{style=\"font-size: 0.7em\"}\nEvents that are *independent* from each other means that the if an event occurs it is in no way related to the occurrence of another event. \n:::\n\n. . . \n\n:::{style=\"font-size: 0.7em\"}\n*Example*\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://em-content.zobj.net/source/telegram/386/cloud-with-rain_1f327-fe0f.webp){fig-align='center' width=15%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{style=\"font-size: 0.7em\"}\nIf we assume that weather events like a rainy day are independent from one another, it means that if it rains today it is unrelated to the weather of yesterday or tomorrow. \n:::\n\n. . .\n\n:::{style=\"font-size: 0.7em\"}\n**Note** : This can be a good or a bad or dangerous assumption to make depending on the problem you are working on.\n:::\n\n## Bernoulli distribution\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Jakob_Bernoulli.jpg/800px-Jakob_Bernoulli.jpg){fig-align='center' width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.r-stack}\nJacob Bernoulli (1655 - 1705)\n:::\n\n## Bernoulli distribution\n\nThe probability distribution (or probability mass function) of the Bernoulli distribution defines the probability of an event to occur given that there is only one other event that can occur (e.g. rain or no rain)\n\n. . . \n\nClassically, we will give a value of 1 to one event (no rain) and 0 to the other (rain). \n\n. . .\n\nFrom a mathematical perspective, it does not matter which event is given a 1 (or a 0). However, often it is common practice to choose how we give values based on the interpretation we make of the results.\n\n## Bernoulli distribution\n\nMathematically, the probability mass function of the Bernoulli distribution can be written as\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\np \\quad & \\text{if} \\quad x =1\\\\\n(1-p) \\quad & \\text{if}\\quad  x =0\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nwhere $p$ is a shorthand for $P(x)$ and $x$ is one of two events.\n\n## Moment interlude\n\nUsing probability distributions is practical because from them we can derive general information characterizing the each distribution.\n\n. . .\n\nThese characteristics are know as [moments]{style=\"color: blue;\"} of a distribution... And you know them :\n\n. . .\n\n- Mean\n- Variance\n- Skewness\n- Kurtosis\n- ... \n\n\n## Moments of the Bernoulli distribution\n\n:::{style=\"font-size: 0.8em\"}\nFor the sake of conciseness, in this course, we will discuss only the first two moments of distributions.\n\n**Mean**\n\n$$p$$\n\n*Example*\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://em-content.zobj.net/source/telegram/386/cloud-with-rain_1f327-fe0f.webp){fig-align='center' width=15%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf the probability that it rains is $p=0.14$ in any given day, it means that, on average in a week (7 days) we should expect it will rain 1 day.\n:::\n\n## Moments of the Bernoulli distribution\n\n:::{style=\"font-size: 0.8em\"}\n**Variance**\n\n$$p(1-p)$$\n*Example*\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://em-content.zobj.net/source/telegram/386/cloud-with-rain_1f327-fe0f.webp){fig-align='center' width=15%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf the probability that it rains is $p=0.5$ in any given day, it means that, across multiple weeks, some weeks might have no rain while some weeks it might rain all days because the variance is\n\n$$p(1-p)=0.5\\times(1-0.5)=0.25\\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\sqrt{0.25} = 0.5$$\n:::\n",
