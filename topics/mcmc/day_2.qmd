what makes a person and approach Bayesian is not the use of Bayes rule.
Bayes rule is just a fact about conditional probability, which everyone uses regardless of their framework for scientific inference.
no, to be bayesian is to use probability to measure uncertainty.



## MCMC

## Convergence Diagnostics

## Model validation with simulation

## DAGs


* forks, pipes and colliders
* simulation from a DAG
* demonstration of errors from disregarding DAGs
