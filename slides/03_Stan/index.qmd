## Stan

[https://mc-stan.org/](https://mc-stan.org/)

> A comprehensive software ecosystem aimed at facilitating the application of Bayesian inference

Full Bayesian statistical inference with MCMC sampling (but not only)

Integrated with most data analysis languages (R, Python, MATLAB, Julia, Stata)


## Why Stan?

* Open source
* Extensive documentation
* Powerful sampling algorithm
* Large and active online community!


# Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)

## HMC

:::{style="font-size: 0.8em"}
Metropolis and Gibbs limitations:

- A lot of tuning to find the best spot between large and small steps
- Inefficient in high-dimensional spaces
- Can't travel long distances between isolated local minimums


**Hamiltonian Monte Carlo**:

- Uses a gradient-based MCMC to reduce the random walk (hence autocorrelation)

  - Static HMC

  - No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS)
