## Illustrative datasets

To illustrate the different models and methods we will discuss in this course, we will rely on a few data sets, which are directly available in different R package

- `mite`, `mite.env` and `mite.xy` available in the `vegan` R package
- `penguins` available in the `palmerpenguins` R package

These datasets are practical because they are manageable in size and will allow you to see how to work out the different example presented in this course.

Let's look at them in more details

# Oribatid mite

## Oribatid mite data

Aside from being a very interesting datasets this data has been sample on the southern shore of Lac Geai (a few minutes walk from here ! We will go see it this week)

Sampling was carried out in June 1989 on the partially floating vegetation mat surrounding the lake from the forest border to the free water by Daniel Borcard

## Oribatid mite data

Oribatid mites are small (usually ranging in size from 0.2 to 1.4 mm) invertebrates that are part of the **Arachnida** class (so they have 8 legs).

In the `mite` data, 35 morphospecies were identified and counted across 70 samples.
